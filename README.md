# Backend-LABEFE

## Description

This project is designed to facilitate online auctions where users can bid on various items in real time.

The main features are:

- User authentication and profile management, allowing users to securely log in, and manage their auction activity.
- Item listing system, enabling sellers to create detailed auction listings with picture, descriptions, and starting prices.
- Real-time bidding, allowing multiple users to place bids and see updates on the current highest offer.
